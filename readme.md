# HANGMAN INTRODUCTION
1. This game will choose a random word out of 3000 for you to guess from.   
2. You have 6 wrong guesses available. One for each body part you can       
    accumilate (head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs) in the actual game.             
3. The name of the game is simple, guess the word and dont strike out!      
4. Guesses must be at least 1 character. You can try to guess the entire word if you would like. Only a-z or A-Z is accepted. No special characters.   
5. Guesses of length > 1 are counted as a word guess.                         
6. Both incorrect characters and word guesses are counted as 1 strike.      
7. Already guessed letters or words are also counted as a strike.           
                                                                             
                              GOOD LUCK!
